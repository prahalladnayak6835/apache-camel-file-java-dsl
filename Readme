TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

TCP is a foundational protocol in computer networking. It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of packets between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.
In the context of messaging systems or message brokers, TCP is often used as a transport protocol for communication between clients and the broker. It ensures reliable and ordered delivery of messages.
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol):

AMQP is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.
It is designed to support messaging between applications or components in a way that is platform-independent, language-agnostic, and supports a variety of messaging patterns.
AMQP provides features like message queuing, routing, reliability, and security. It's particularly popular in enterprise messaging systems.
STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol):

STOMP is a text-based wire protocol for messaging.
It is simpler compared to protocols like AMQP and is often used for lightweight messaging scenarios.
STOMP is widely supported by various messaging brokers and client libraries, making it a good choice for interoperability between different systems and languages.
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):

MQTT is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.
It is commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) scenarios due to its efficiency and simplicity.
MQTT follows a publish-subscribe model where clients publish messages to topics, and other clients subscribe to those topics to receive messages.
